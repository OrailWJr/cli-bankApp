Objective:
Your goal in this exercise is to create a simple banking program. A person should be able to
deposit funds into their account, withdraw funds from it, and see their current balance.

Detailed Steps:

Create a Person class with a name property to represent the account holder.

Create a BankAccount class associated with the Person class. This class should have at
least two properties: balance and owner. The balance should be a number, and the owner should be of type Person.

Write a method within the BankAccount class for depositing money. This method should
accept one argument: the amount to be deposited. It should increase the balance by the amount of the deposit.

Write another method within the BankAccount class for withdrawing money. This method
should accept one argument: the amount to be withdrawn. It should decrease the balance by the amount of the withdrawal,
but should first check to ensure that the withdrawal will not result in a negative balance.
If the withdrawal would result in a negative balance, it should print an error message saying "insufficient funds".

Write a third method within the BankAccount class for displaying the current balance.

In your main program, create a Person object and a BankAccount object associated with that person.
Use the methods you've defined to deposit some money into the account, withdraw some money from the account,
and display the current balance.

Expected Output:

Ask a user what the name, age and date of birth is to create a person class. Then ask how much they want to deposit into their account ...

The output of your program should reflect the deposits and withdrawals made, and should correctly
display the current balance. If a withdrawal is attempted that would result in a negative balance, an error
message should be displayed.
